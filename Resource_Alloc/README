# Sustainable Resource Allocation Optimization

## Project Overview
A machine learning approach to optimize resource allocation using PyTorch, focusing on sustainable and balanced resource distribution.

## Key Features
- Synthetic data generation for resource scenarios
- Neural network for optimization scoring
- Adaptive learning and regularization
- Interdependency modeling

## Resource Dimensions
1. Energy sources
2. Water resources
3. Agricultural land
4. Raw materials
5. Labor availability

## Dependencies
- PyTorch
- NumPy

## Model Highlights
- Dynamic feature scaling
- Batch normalization
- Dropout regularization
- Adaptive learning rate

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

## Methodology
The model predicts an optimization score by balancing:
- Resource availability
- Demand
- Sustainability weights
- Resource interdependencies

## Notes
This is a simplified demonstration of resource allocation optimization.
