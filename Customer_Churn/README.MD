## 💡 Key Insights

Based on the model analysis, the most important factors for churn prediction are:
1. **Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts have higher churn
2. **Tenure**: Newer customers are more likely to churn
3. **Monthly Charges**: Higher charges increase churn risk
4. **Internet Service**: Fiber optic customers churn more frequently
5. **Payment Method**: Electronic check payments correlate with churn

## 🎯 Business Recommendations
