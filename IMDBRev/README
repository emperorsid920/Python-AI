# IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
A deep learning project for sentiment classification of movie reviews using an LSTM neural network, based on the IMDb dataset.

## Project Structure
- `Review.py`: Main script containing:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model architecture
  - Training and evaluation
  - Visualization of training metrics

## Technical Details

### Data Preprocessing
- Dataset: IMDb Movie Reviews
- Tokenization: 
  - Top 5000 words preserved
  - Sequences padded to 100 tokens
- Train-Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing

### Model Architecture
- Embedding Layer: 
  - Input dimension: 5000
  - Output dimension: 64
- LSTM Layer: 64 units
- Output Layer: Binary sigmoid classifier

### Training Parameters
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Epochs: 10
- Batch Size: 64

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed
2. Place `IMDb_Reviews.csv` in the same directory
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Review.py
   ```

## Outputs
- Training and validation accuracy plot
- Training and validation loss plot
- Final test set performance metrics

## Model Performance Visualization
- Accuracy and loss curves for both training and validation sets
- Helps in understanding model learning progress

## Potential Improvements
- Experiment with different model architectures
- Try larger embedding dimensions
- Increase number of training epochs
- Implement more advanced text preprocessing
- Use pre-trained word embeddings

## Limitations
- Limited to top 5000 words
- Fixed sequence length of 100 tokens
- Binary sentiment classification

## Notes
Ensure you have the IMDb dataset (`IMDb_Reviews.csv`) before running the script.
