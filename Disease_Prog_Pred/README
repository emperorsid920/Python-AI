# Disease Progression Prediction Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to predicting disease progression using synthetic healthcare data and TensorFlow.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Contains data generation and main execution logic
- `ml_model.py`: Defines the neural network model and training process

## Key Features
- Synthetic data generation for healthcare indicators
- Neural network regression model
- Feature normalization
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
```

## Model Details
The model predicts a disease progression score (0-10) based on:
- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Level
- Blood Sugar
- BMI

## Note
This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes.
