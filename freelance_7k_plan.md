## The Psychology: Aim High, Hit Realistic

### Why This Works:
- **$5K target** pushes you to take more aggressive action
- **$4K reality** is still excellent progress and covers all expenses
- **Having a stretch goal** prevents settling for "good enough"
- **Built-in buffer** accounts for rejections and delays

### Risk Mitigation:
- If behind target: Focus on volume (more small projects)
- If ahead of target: Raise prices and focus on premium clients
- If market resistance: Lower prices temporarily to maintain momentum
- If burnout risk: Focus on higher-value, fewer projects
