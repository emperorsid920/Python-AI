1,Flawless service and top notch staff!,5,2025-05-10,Adrian S
2,"Positively excellent handling of the problem. Not only did they take a 13 year laptop with worked out charge ports, it was handled expeditiously, professionally and with pleasure. Highly recommended",5,2025-05-10,Atilla Hun
3,These people are legends. I Love Louis,5,2025-06-10,Open The Window
4,Been watching on youtube for a long time and eventually it was my turn to use his data recovery services. I was expecting to pay over $1000 for the data on my phone but it ended up being less than that. Shipping to and from was fast and the service was excellent.,5,2025-06-10,Tri Viszla
5,"My satisfaction with Rossmann Repair Group goes beyond just 5 stars. I had a hard drive die some time ago, but I had no idea where I could send it knowing it would be safe, or there being a chance I'd be ripped off. After watching Louis's videos, I decided to trust them with my data recovery needs.",5,2025-06-19,Kyle Hartley (crazybangles)
6,"I've been watching Louis for a long time, and I've LOVED Macs for a long time; and he's inspired me to fix all of my own. I wanted to support his business, so I did a mail in repair on my 2019 MBP 16 inch for a trackpad replacement. It was done, works good as new Louis, thank you and your team for everything you do; especially for right to repair. Thank you for inspiring me to fix my own equipment, and making your mail in repair super easy",5,2025-06-12,Jackson Deckard
7,"Rossmann was able to repair my 2022 M2 macbook logic board!!! Prior, I took it to two shops in San Jose, CA that claimed they were able to do logic board repairs. I thought I might as well try to get it repair locally before sending it to San Antonio, TX. That was a bad move. One said I needed to replace the logic board and the other said I had to replace the whole macbook because the logic board was fried from the water damage. These shops in California wasted my time and messed with the logic board even though it was supposed to be a diagnostic. Rossmann Repair Group on the other hand said they will be able to repair it, but with the prior work, they won't know for sure. A week later, they notified me to let me know the repair was a success! If anyone has doubts about their capabilities, don't. Send your macbook to them and know that you'll be in good hands. They don't charge any diagnostic fee, which is a plus! They will go above and beyond to ensure you have a working computer after their care. They even replaced my power button for free!",5,2025-06-10,C K
8,"Haven't had any repairs here yet, but I am a big fan of Louis' work online. I have been watching his craft and his business grow since i was in my teens. It has inspired me to work in electronics repair as well. From what I have seen online from Louis' work and his highly skilled team, they got their techniques down very well. Would highly recommend this business for any kind of repairs, complex or simple.",5,2025-06-10,_Rat_
9,"Overwhelmingly positive experience. An actual human being answered on the first ring. And they were capable of listening and explaining the troubleshooting process I'd need on my laptop. Not only did they give me an estimate and a likely diagnosis of what was wrong with my laptop, but they also made it clear they'd need to see it in person to be sure. When I brought in my MSI laptop, I found out they only work on Apple devices. Fortunately, being mostly mature adults, we both recognized the communication gap and acknowledged ways to improve. I was amazed that this store actually exists and that Louis Rossmann is exactly like he is on YouTube. Unfortunately, I was so excited to be there that I didn't even notice they sell tools, so I missed out on buying something. Totally awesome place. Looking forward to doing business with them in the future!",5,2025-04-10,Daniel Robbins
10,"Early last week I sent my mac book pro to Rossmann Repair group in Austin, TX. 7 days later, my laptop is repaired to as brand new! Since January my laptop would not power on and after communicating with the repair group I learned that it needed a logic board repair and a new battery. I'm so glad to have discovered Rossmann repair because then I would have bought a new laptop. I definitely recommend them!",5,2025-04-10,Veronica Sullivan
11,Only complaint is that they put stickers on your device with your name and email. Took me an hour to remove all the sticky gunk they put on it.,4,2025-06-10,Gray Pruitt
12,Excellent care and service!,5,2025-06-10,Lara
13,"If you enjoy drama, go ahead and deal with them — otherwise, stay away at all costs.",1,2025-07-09,Ruslan Overchuk
14,Rossman Hits It Out of the Park Again!!! So this is the 2nd time I have sent a MacBook to Rossman Repair to be fixed. I came across them while frantically looking for someone to repair my MacBook. The first time I had a liquid spill and they fixed it perfectly.,5,2025-07-05,Charmaine Sealey
15,"They don't repair tablets, they just recover information, Save your money on the paid parking.",1,2025-06-26,Brian Salazar
16,Very honest people. They gave me a quote but also referred me to the Apple Store who could do it a little cheaper. The Apple Store was able to give me a free repair! I totally recommend 100%.,5,2025-06-26,Joshua Smiley
17,I admire Louis rossman. He taught me alot . So yeha .!,5,2025-05-10,WHY
18,They fixed my AirPod case for free by cleaning out the changing port properly while showing me around in their workshop.,5,2025-05-10,Yorick Reum
19,Good service,5,2025-05-10,Keaton G
20,Service was excellent.,5,2025-05-10,Abdurrahman Seydoglu
21,The repair was done well.,5,2025-05-10,Niyaz Aqmar
22,"Great work on my computer, will recommend family and friends use these guys.",5,2025-03-10,Alec Ritter
23,"Getting to this location is 80% of the battle without running over students on bikes, foot or scooters coming out of nowhere. This location has a dedicated parking spot which is helpful. Once you get past the parking situation and get inside this building, you find out that they have dual locations - enter the left entrance for the repair shop. The right entrance is where you get to repair your own machine and learn how to use their tools. The owner Louis Rossmann is sort of a celebrity with thousands of YouTube videos and millions of views. This shop lives up to that brand and he has hired nothing but the best staff. The customer service goes above and beyond what you unfortunately find in most IT shops.",5,2025-04-10,Shane Anciso
24,This is one of the most upstanding repair shops I've ever seen. You will not regret doing business with Rossmann Repair Group! The staff is super knowledgeable and very nice!,5,2025-02-10,Mazy N
25,I was going to drive by the shop and ask some questions but I decided just to call. Kevin answered the phone and later through an email he sent me some links that would help me out with my old 2009 MacBook Pro. I appreciate the help. Thanks.,5,2025-03-10,ZEPRAT GERNODT (ZEPRATGERNODT)
26,"Couldn't ask for a better experience. I spilled liquid on my MacBook Air. It wasn't a big spill, but I sent it to Rossman Repair and they cleaned it, fixed the wonky charging port, and unstuck a few keys. All of this for the cost of shipping! I can't recommend them enough. It took two weeks for the mail in repair, and most of that was shipping time. They were professional and responsive to top if off!",5,2025-03-10,Matthew Bader
27,"I took my phone to this repair shop to get it fixed and they said it could be fixed. Instead of fixing it, they just recovered my data and sent it back. They charged me $600 for this! If the phone wasn't going to be fixed, why didn't they tell me that in the first place? Giving misleading information up front and charging such a high fee is completely unacceptable. Would not recommend for anyone who wants reliable and honest service!",1,2025-03-10,selim ağcakaya
28,"My MacBook Pro needed some old-machine love - new keyboard, speaker repair, and the charging ports on the right side weren't working. For approximately $450, I got my machine back in pristine shape, well packed and promptly shipped. Everything was restored to perfect working condition.",5,2025-03-10,Lauren Schneider
29,"The owner of Rossmann Repair group Inc does what's best for his customers the best he can in this market of anti right to repair laws. Apple would be a more valuable company by letting him do his work without impedance. He's straightforward and honest. I have never had an Apple device to repair, but I listen to his advice because it makes sense. If you need to hear the truth, he is your man and his employees are the same. Just logical to treat people as you want to be treated. A++ Rated.",5,2025-03-10,David Johnson
30,Lost data from harddrive that would not read - they got my data off in time for me to file my tax forms,5,2025-03-10,zeldafreek22
31,I can't recommend this company enough! They did exactly what I asked. They did it on time and within the price quote. Very professional. Highly recommend Rossman Group.,5,2025-04-10,Joe Mcnemar
32,"My m1 macbook pro decided to take a drink of a full cup of water which resulted in a fried logic board. The team over at Rossman Repair Group managed to get my computer fully repaired and saved the computer in every way. It's like the computer never died. Fully functional, all data right where I left it. It's like it never happened. I paid the rush delivery fee to get my work computer back online faster and these guys did excellent work. I cannot recommend this company more! Thank you guys! As a fellow small business owner I am in pure astonishment about your quality of work. -Keegan",5,2025-04-10,KeeganBuilds
33,"I came in having no problems, got free diagnostics and turned out I do have problems, said problems were fixed after a few hours which saved my life if it wasn't fixed. When you get used to abuse, services like these looks like a miracle.",5,2025-04-10,Emman
34,"Sent my hdd for data recovery, process was simple and I was able to pre-authorize an amount. They worked on my drive within 2 days of receiving it and the total cost was literally 1/10th of the amount of another service I got a quote from. Professional, quick, affordable. Nothing to complain about.",5,2025-04-10,Andrew Hansen
35,"I was referred to this company via a friend who I trust undoubtedly in tech. So, I knew they had to be good....and they were! Their process is exactly what is shared online. The team was very responsive, accommodating and helpful. I couldn't be happier to receive all my lost work/data back again. I appreciate Rossmann being such an honest and trustworthy tech company which you don't see too often because most tech/data recovery companies will use your loss for their financial gain...Rossmann doesn't operate like this. To those who are looking for data recovery services/repair, I highly, highly recommend this company.",5,2025-02-10,Diandra Renee
36,"They did outstanding work, quickly and professionally. I could not be more pleased.",5,2025-01-10,Matt Thompson
37,Top notch work,5,2025-02-10,Husrav H
38,Phone was having major issues with charging. They worked on it for 30 minutes and gave it back to me working perfectly. When I asked how much to pay they said its free. I tried to tip them and they refused. Will definitely be going back.,5,2025-02-10,Nick Olazabal
39,"These people are so annoying. I'll never forget how I tried to give them money, but they initially refused. They said the repair was covered by Apple. I had to explain that I don't trust Apple, but I trust Rossmann. My question was, would they lose money from doing the repair? She said no, so I implored her to please do the repair. Shut up and take my money meme goes here. TLDR if you want a terrible experience, this is not your company. They will treat you better than you treat yourself. You might even be inspired to start a family or something else to make the world better. Proceed with caution.",5,2025-02-10,Tim
40,"I don't really support Mac stuff so when my Mom ran into an iPhone issue, I sent it to the Rossmann repair group. High quality service. I'll gladly send any future Mac issues I have here.",5,2025-02-10,Garnack 17
41,They have repaired countless macbooks.,5,2025-02-10,Lubomir Georgiev
42,"My MacBook Pro (A1990) bricked and would not turn back on. I had years of family photos and important documents that were not backed up. Panicking, I first tried bringing my laptop to the local UBreakIFix. After weeks of delays and false promises (including losing my laptop for a few days), UBreakIFix told me that the logic board was damaged and I would need to pay for a replacement logic board, screen, and keyboard. In addition, my data would be unrecoverable. They were also insistent that I sell them my non-functioning MacBook, and I had to argue for days to get them to return my laptop so I could seek out other options. After doing my own research into logic board repairs for my specific model, I found out about Rossmann Repair and learned that it was indeed possible to fix my MacBook and recover my data. In fact, Louis had videos of my model's specific logic board being repaired on his YouTube channel. Unfortunately, they had moved out of the NYC area and I was hesitant to mail my laptop out due to my own skepticism. So, I searched for local specialists in Connecticut and found ThingMac. My first conversation with one of their employees immediately made me feel that I was in good hands. The technicians ran some tests on my computer and eventually determined that, while they could not fix my MacBook in house, they knew about a place that could: Rossmann Repair. ThingMac sent my laptop to Austin for me and dealt with all the communication with Rossmann. In the end, after being told by UBreakIFix and Apple that my data was unrecoverable and my computer would never turn on again, the folks at Rossmann Repair proved them wrong. My computer has been as good as new for the last 4 months and I was able to recover all of my data. While my experience with Rossmann Repair was indirect, I cannot recommend them enough. They took a devastating situation and turned it into a positive experience. Thank you for fixing my MacBook!",5,2025-01-10,MP Bankz
43,I respect this business and their guiding principles. I wish more held themselves to the same standards.,5,2025-02-10,Casey Lewis
44,"I sent over a badly damaged & abused MacBook from over a decade ago, it had USB port issues, missing battery (I had to take it out because it was swollen), broken keyboard and more issues. $350 later, I got it back in just a few days and wow they did a really good job!! Seems fully functional, and on top of that they also fixed the broken case, fixed the display hinge, replaced the missing screws in the bottom, pretty much everything. Really feels like they went above & beyond, absolutely amazing first experience!!",5,2025-02-10,LoganDark
45,The absolute best laptop repair business in America. In Rossman we trust.,5,2025-02-10,Nick Bedard
46,Professionalism at its finest,5,2025-02-10,Ibrahim Saleh
47,"Great service, and they took care of battery replacement right away. If you have any mac issues this is the place to come to.",5,2025-02-10,Roni
48,"Hands down the BEST tech service around; nice team and amazing service. My mac had some water spill on it, and now it runs better than ever after the repair that was only $200 - lower than any other spot",5,2025-03-10,Daniel Martin
49,Best repair shop on the planet. They did a same day battery replacement on a MacBook Pro for $50 less than Apple was charging and Apple doesn't even offer same day replacements - they make you wait 3-5 business days while they ship it out to California or god knows where. Also the staff are awesome. You'd have to be a masochist to deal with the terrible service offered by Apple or any other Apple authorized repair place when a place like Rossman Repair Group exists.,5,2024-12-10,Calin Culianu
