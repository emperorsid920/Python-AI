üöÄ Quick Start
1. Clone the Repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/sp500-predictor.git
cd sp500-predictor
2. Install Dependencies
bashpip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Predictor
bashpython sp500_simple_model.py
The script will automatically:

Fetch S&P 500 data from Yahoo Finance
Create technical indicators
Train the LSTM model
Generate predictions and visualizations
Save results to CSV files

üìà How It Works
1. Data Collection

Fetches S&P 500 historical data from Yahoo Finance
Uses web scraping as primary method with manual fallback
Creates daily data from monthly observations

2. Feature Engineering
The model uses 24 technical indicators:
Price Indicators:

Simple Moving Averages (5, 10, 20, 50 days)
Exponential Moving Averages (12, 26 days)
Price momentum and rate of change

Technical Oscillators:

RSI (Relative Strength Index)
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
Stochastic Oscillator
Williams %R

Volatility Indicators:

Bollinger Bands (width and position)
Average True Range (ATR)
Price volatility measures

Volume Analysis:

Volume moving averages
Volume ratios and trends

3. Model Architecture
python# LSTM Neural Network
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.LSTM(50, return_sequences=True),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.LSTM(50, return_sequences=False),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(25, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')
])
Key Features:

2-layer LSTM with 50 units each
Dropout layers for regularization
60-day sequence length for pattern recognition
Predicts next-day percentage price change

4. Training Process

Data Split: 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing
Optimization: Adam optimizer with adaptive learning rate
Callbacks: Early stopping, learning rate reduction, model checkpointing
Epochs: Up to 100 with early stopping

üìä Visualizations
The model generates comprehensive visualizations:

Stock Price History - Historical S&P 500 price and volume charts
Training Progress - Loss and accuracy over training epochs
Prediction Analysis - Actual vs predicted price movements
Error Distribution - Prediction error patterns and statistics
Feature Importance - Most influential technical indicators
Trading Performance - Directional accuracy and confidence analysis

üéØ Results & Analysis
Model Output Includes:
Performance Metrics:

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers
This project is for educational and research purposes only.

Not Financial Advice: Predictions should not be used as the sole basis for investment decisions
Past Performance: Historical patterns don't guarantee future results
Risk Management: Always implement proper risk management and position sizing
Market Volatility: Stock markets are inherently unpredictable and volatile

üîß Customization Options
Modify Model Parameters
python# In sp500_simple_model.py
SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 60        # Days of historical data to use
LSTM_UNITS = 50            # LSTM layer size
EPOCHS = 100               # Maximum training epochs
BATCH_SIZE = 32            # Training batch size
Adjust Technical Indicators
python# In data.py - modify preprocess_data() function
df['sma_custom'] = df['close'].rolling(30).mean()  # Add custom SMA
df['custom_indicator'] = your_custom_calculation()   # Add custom indicator
Change Stock Symbol
The current version focuses on S&P 500 index, but the framework can be adapted for individual stocks by modifying the data fetching functions.

üîç FAQ
Q: How accurate are the predictions?
A: The model typically achieves 55-70% directional accuracy. While this is better than random (50%), it's important to remember that stock prediction is inherently difficult and uncertain.
Q: Can I use this for real trading?
A: This project is for educational purposes. If you plan to use it for actual trading, please:

Thoroughly backtest the strategy
Implement proper risk management
Start with small position sizes
Consult with financial professionals

Q: Why does the model sometimes perform poorly?
A: Stock markets are influenced by many factors not captured in technical indicators alone, including:

Breaking news and events
Economic policy changes
Market sentiment and psychology
Unexpected global events

Q: Can I modify it for other stocks?
A: Yes! The framework can be adapted for individual stocks by modifying the data fetching functions, though you may need to adjust the model parameters for different volatility patterns.
Q: What's the minimum data required?
A: The model needs at least 200-300 days of historical data to train effectively, though more data (1-2 years) generally produces better results.
