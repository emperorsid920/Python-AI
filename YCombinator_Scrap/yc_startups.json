    "company_name": "Meesho",
    "description": "Meesho \u2013 short for Meri Shop (My Shop) \u2013 was founded by Vidit Aatery and Sanjeev Barnwal in 2015. Vidit and Sanjeev were wing mates at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi hostel, with their rooms located diagonally opposite each other. Upon completion of their engineering, Vidit worked with Indian consumer goods major ITC for a couple of years, followed by a year-long stint at ad-tech startup InMobi. Sanjeev joined Sony in Japan, contributing to the camera technology for DSLRs and mobiles. ****\\The duo got back in touch in May 2015 and decided to start up. For them, two things were clear.\u00a0 One, it was a great time to be a tech entrepreneur in India \u2013 doing anything else would mean not living up to their potential. Two, solving a large-scale problem that affects more than 100 million people and something they can relate to. \\Soon, Vidit and Sanjeev realized that most small businesses in India were still offline. They only sold within their communities and localities, which limited their earning potential. \\On the consumer side, traditional e-commerce companies focused on the metros and relatively affluent consumers, leaving smaller cities and those with lower incomes out of the internet commerce revolution. Vidit and Sanjeev wanted to take the benefits of e-commerce to this cohort of consumers, democratizing internet commerce for everyone. \\To that end, Vidit and Sanjeev gauged the immense potential of social networks as a sales channel early on. They created a platform that enabled millions of people, including homemakers, to become entrepreneurs and resell products in their network via WhatsAp. Meesho pioneered social commerce in India and it now has ~16 million entrepreneurs on the platform, of which over 10 million are women. \\What started as an idea to digitize India\u2019s unorganized retail is now a $4.9B e-commerce company, a single thriving ecosystem of sellers, entrepreneurs and consumers. Meesho\u2019s evolution from pure play social commerce to e-commerce is a testament to how the company is transforming the industry and making e-commerce accessible to the masses. With a vision to enable 100 million small businesses to succeed online, Meesho is continuously facilitating MSMEs\u2019 transition from the offline to the online world. Put simply, Vidit and Sanjeev decided to apply to Y Combinator because they were fans of Paul Graham's iconic essays \ud83d\ude42They were hungry to learn how to start up from great mentors and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley \u2013 the global hub of tech innovations and startups.\u00a0Y Combinator\u2019s application process made Vidit and Sanjeev think hard about what they were building, what unique insight they had that no one else did, etc. Some of these fundamental questions helped refine their thinking a great deal.\u00a0While going through the batch, they learned a lot about growth and user behavior from other startups. At the same time, Y Combinator partners connected them to other entrepreneurs like Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear, who shared valuable advice with Vidit and Sanjeev on how to get insights from users to build products. The Y Combinator community is very active, both in India as well as globally. Vidit and Sanjeev are now close friends with some of the other Y Combinator founders. They often brainstorm together on the challenges they are working on, always learning something new in the process.",
